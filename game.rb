# Build a ğŸª¨/ğŸ§»/ğŸ’‡

# ğŸª¨ beats ğŸ’‡
# ğŸ§» beats ğŸª¨
# ğŸ’‡ beats ğŸ§»
# same result draw

# Pseudo-code
# 1. Define choices (done already..)
# 2. Welcome the user, and ask for ğŸª¨/ğŸ§»/ğŸ’‡
# 3. Get user input
# 4. Get a random computer pick
# 5. Compare the user input and computer pick
# 6. If same, puts "Your pick is X, computer pick is Y: it's a Draw!"
# 7. If UğŸ§»/CğŸª¨ or UğŸ’‡/CğŸ§» or UğŸª¨/CğŸ’‡, puts "Your pick is X, computer pick is Y: you win!"
# 8. Else, puts "Your pick is X, computer pick is Y: you lose"
